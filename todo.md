Main idea for nonotes interface: 
  - open (open markdown explorer)
  - edit (edit existing markdown or streamlit ???)
  - setup (setup log directory and markdown editor, maybe use conf file)
  - explore (tags ??)
  - search (fuzzy search, with or without interface)
  - create (create new note with template(s)?)
  - log (log some notes in daily? note)

Remaining to test with textual approach:  
- have a view options that display the full markdown content (with images and extensions) **Delayed**

Remaining to do CLI: 
- Read realpython tutorial
- Add "init" command with configuration file creation
- Add "edit" command with menu file selection
- Add "new" command with menu directory selection

> Step 1 : Quick note taking / view with CLI 
> Step 2 : add todos support (simple textual / streamlit app)
> Step 3 : Better markdown view 
> Step 4 : Enable fuzzy search notes
